# RORI

RORI is a modulable open-source chatterbot under [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL#Version_2). The first version was written in 2011 (2.0 in September 2012) and this is a repository for the third (and last) version (re-written in Rust with a new architecture).

A complete RORI chain needs 4 things:

![processus](rsc/process.png?raw=true)

1. An **entry point** is a application which get commands from an user and send it to `rori_server`. For example, a chat where the entry point reads what users says.
2. An **endpoint** is a application which performs actions requested by RORI. For example, it can execute a shell command or write something in a chat.
3. A **module** is a script activated when a condition is fulfilled and send actions for endpoints to RORI.
4. The **rori_server** which get data from entries, call modules, and send data to endpoints.

# Why RORI?

I run a lot of chatterbots on multiple services (IRC, Discord, Websites, my computer). Some bots do the exact same thing but run on a different service. The idea is to avoid to rewrite the core of each chatterbot and use the same base. Now, I just have to write an interface to communicate with this core on each services.

# Run your instance

In the future, if a chain is online, you will just have to connect your part. But, for now, you can run a complete chain for you. You will need at least an entry point, a `rori_server` with some modules and an endpoint to execute actions. In the future, a website with some pre-configured nodes will be available (or a website which groups all useful entry/endpoints and modules), but for now, you have to run your own nodes. You can check _clients/_ to find currently available entry/endpoints and _rori_server/rori_modules_ to find modules. For more informations, you can read the [wiki](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/rori/wiki) of this repository or the _README.md_ of sub-projects.
